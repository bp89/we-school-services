### Language

**Choose a primary language** 

Java in my case for now:
- Java language
  - Core Java
  - Java design patterns
  - OOPS concepts

**A framework for service based architecture learning:**
- Spring-boot
     - For rest services

- micro-services design patterns

- Design
  - High level design
  - Low level design
  - System design

**Strategical**

#### - Data structures & Algorithms

- Give yourself sufficient preparation time. Its always better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.

| Level in DSA | Preparation Time |
|--------------|------------------|
| Beginner     | 6-12 Months      |
| Intermediate | 2-3 months       |
| Advanced     | 4 weeks          |

Coding platforms:


| Type of Problems | Quantity(%) |
|------------------|-------------|
| Easy             | 10          |
| Medium           | 30          |
| Hard             | 60          |

Video explanations are my cup of tea! Naming few channels with helpful content â€” Rachit Jain, Abdul Bari, Tushar Roy (awesome walkthroughs!) and BackToBack SWE.


**Important for cracking coding rounds:**

1. Communication and collaboration
2. Algorithms and data structures
3. Coding
4. Testing and Error checking
5. Best practices
